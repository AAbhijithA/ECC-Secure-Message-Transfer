# ECC-Secure-Message-Transfer
Implemented Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for secure message transfers between a Client and Server Model in Java with socket programming. ECC is as one-way encryption of emails, data and software and a popular alternative to RSA Algorithm. The algorithm is implemented as a part of our internal assessment for our coursework

### Parameters Used
>* ECC Equation : E(1,1) -> y^2 = x^3 + x + 1
>* G of order 333 = (333^2 + 333 + 1)^(1/2)
>* n value is 256 and na, nb generated randomly lesser than n
>* k value generated randomly between 1 and 1000
