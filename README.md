# ECC-Secure-Message-Transfer
Implemented Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for secure message transfers between a Client and Server Model in Java with socket programming. Done as a part of our internal assessment for our coursework. ECC is used in applications like digital signatures in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as one-way encryption of emails, data and software.
